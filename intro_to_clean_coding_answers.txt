1. Clean code is code that is written in such a way that it is inherently readable and understandable, simple, and easy to maintain, usually designed using various principles and best practices in mind. Ideally, it is code that is not only understood by the author, but quickly understood by most other readers and is not overly complicated or bloated with redundancy and excessive comments.

2. Maybe not commonly used, but certainly life-critical and something many depend on, a poorly designed pacemaker (implanted computer to monitor and alter heart rhythms) has the potential to fail catastrophically. The pacemaker is unique because it is implanted in a patients chest and battery-operated - thus, it must be designed in  such a way to safely perform its desired function (monitor the heart and distribute electric currents as necessary), monitor its own battery-life, and, in the case of some newer pacemakers, interface with certain hardware at patient check-ups to ensure the pacemaker is functioning as intended. Usually, these pacemakers are implanted via surgery, and when the battery is low, a new one is implanted. A good example of a recent problem with pacemakers is from 2017, when the FDA mandated that some 500,000 pacemakers made by a certain company would need a firmware update, as they had been radio-enabled for interfacing, yet interfacing with the pacemaker was open - there was no authorization required, so it was found that anyone who wanted to and was within range of the pacemaker, could theoretically access the pacemaker and make changes, potentially maliciously or ignorantly (without physician guidance). Most of the affected patients had to visit their healthcare provider to receive the firmware update.

3. Definitely not, first, it fails the squint test: we have odd chunks of comments off to the right, and the actual code to the left is indented in an odd way. Next, it's not really self-documented - we have to look into what the variables x, y, and z actually represent. Additionally, it does not follow DRY - we end up printing Z twice when we could simply do so once, at the end.
```
FUNCTION do(temperature, units)
  IF units is equal to 'fahrenheit' OR 'F' THEN
    SET convertedTemperature to (temperature - 32) * (5/9) // degrees fahrenheit to celsius formula
  ELSE IF units is equal to 'celsius' OR 'C' THEN
    SET convertedTemperature to (temperature * 9/5 + 32) // degrees celsius to fahrenheit formula
  END IF
  PRINT convertedTemperature
END FUNCTION
```

4. This is clean code - it is simple, readable, and easily understood at first glance. The variables are well named (as well as the function itself), the logic is simple and not overly nested, and has a single, obvious responsibility (converts to percentages). I would not refactor this code.

5a.
```
FUNCTION calcTotal(subTotal, discountRate, tax)
   SET total to subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + totalDue
   RETURN totalDue
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION checkoutCustomer(paymentType)
   CALL calcTotal WITH subTotal, discountRate, tax RETURNING totalDue
   CALL getPayment RETURNING amountPaid
   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       SET change to amountPaid - totalDue
       PRINT "Change due: " + change
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " totalDue
   END IF
END FUNCTION
```

5b.
```
FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
  CALL isCheckoutPermitted WITH guest
  IF isCheckoutPermitted is TRUE THEN
    APPEND booksLoaning to guest.books
    SET book.status to 'Checked Out'
    PRINT 'Your book has been issued'
  ELSE IF isCheckoutPermitted is FALSE THEN
    PRINT 'Unable to check out book.'
  END IF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION isCheckoutPermitted(guest)
  IF guest.isAccountActive AND NOT guest.hasOverdueBooks AND guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
    RETURN TRUE
  ELSE
    RETURN FALSE
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

5c. Other than following the SRP and making a new class to handle making offers, there's not much I would refactor - methods are reasonably extracted, each class handles a unique task and functions within that task similarly handle specific tasks associated with it, the variables are well-named and seems to be self-documented well.
```
CLASS BankAccount
 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET balance to balance - amount
     END IF
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
 
CLASS MakeOffers
 FUNCTION creditCardOffer
     IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
         CALL offerCreditCard
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION checkStatus
     IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
         CALL offerCheckingAccount
     END
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
```

6.
```
function calcSum(integersArray) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i<integersArray.length; i++){
    sum += integersArray[i];
  }
  return sum;
}

function displayPerfectSquare(integersArray){
  let sum = calcSum(integersArray);
  let squareValue = Math.sqrt(sum);
  if (sum % squareValue === 0){
    return `The sum of the array (${sum}) is a perfect square, which is: ${squareValue}`;
  }
  return `The sum of the array is not a perfect square, the sum is: ${sum}`;
}

```
7.
```
function checkDuplicate(arrayOne, arrayTwo){
  for(let i = 0; i<arrayOne.length; i++){
    for(let k = 0; k<arrayTwo.length; k++){
      if (arrayOne[i]===arrayTwo[k]){
        console.log(`Value of '${arrayOne[i]}' from first array matches second array at indices ${i} and ${k}, respectively.`);
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

Extra credit:

For this, I was wondering about how to balance over-engineering against single-responsibility and method extraction. Here are three code snippets, each solves the anagram problem, however they feel over-engineered. I would say the third block is the best - there's method extraction, over-nesting is eliminated, and it's pretty straight-forward as to what the code does. However, the second code block is shorter, and while it nests a little more, it feels less over-engineered.

1.
```
function stringToArray(word){
  let characterArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i<word.length; i++){
    characterArray.push(word[i]);
  }
  return characterArray;
}

function areAnagrams(wordOne, wordTwo){
  let firstArray = stringToArray(wordOne);
  let secondArray = stringToArray(wordTwo);
  
  let firstSorted = firstArray.sort();
  let secondSorted = secondArray.sort();

  if (firstArray.length === secondArray.length){
    for (let i = 0; i<firstArray.length; i++){
      if (firstSorted[i] === secondSorted[i] && i === firstArray.length-1){
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

console.log(areAnagrams('hello', 'hello'));
console.log(areAnagrams('hello', 'nope'));
console.log(areAnagrams('hello', 'olleh'));
```
2)
```
function areAnagrams(wordOne, wordTwo){
  let firstSplit = wordOne.split('');
  let secondSplit = wordTwo.split('');

  let firstSorted = firstSplit.sort();
  let secondSorted = secondSplit.sort();

  if (firstSplit.length === firstSplit.length){
    for (let i = 0; i<firstSplit.length; i++){
      if (firstSorted[i] === secondSorted[i] && i === firstSplit.length-1){
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

console.log(areAnagrams('hello', 'hello'));
console.log(areAnagrams('hello', 'nope'));
console.log(areAnagrams('hello', 'olleh'));
```

```
function isSameLength(firstArray, secondArray){
  if (firstArray.length === secondArray.length){
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

function areAnagrams(wordOne, wordTwo){
  if (!isSameLength(wordOne, wordTwo)){
    return false;
  } 

  let firstSplit = wordOne.split('');
  let secondSplit = wordTwo.split('');
  
  let firstSorted = firstSplit.sort();
  let secondSorted = secondSplit.sort();

  for (let i = 0; i<firstSplit.length; i++){
    if (firstSorted[i] === secondSorted[i] && i === firstSplit.length-1){
      return true;

  return false;
